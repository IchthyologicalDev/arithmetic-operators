/*
Welcome to the js exercise template! This paragraph should be changed for
each exercise. It is intended to give some high level instruction about the 
exercise goal. The rest of this multi-line comment should be included in every
exercise.

Look through this file for requirements that start with //REQUIREMENT N:
You will add your code on the line or lines that start with //TODO:

EXAMPLE:
//REQUIREMENT 1: Do Ichthyologists study fish, birds, or mammals?
//TODO: On the following lines, change null to your answer. Make sure that it's a string!
let ichthyologistFocus = null;

You would change the previous line so that it says: 
let ichthyologistFocus = 'fish';

You will occasionally see longer comments (like this one) that will include extra
instruction, helpful hints, best practices, or other content. 

IMPORTANT
You should have the index.html file open in your browser as you work through this
exercise. If you aren't sure what this means, you should watch the How to Edit Code 
video: https://youtu.be/vkWDQzl_x3s before continuing.

I hope that you get hooked on coding!

REQUIREMENT My calculator is broken. When I try to do 5 + 5, it returns 55.

//TODO: On the following lines, create a function named add that takes in two parameters that are either strings or numbers and returns the numeric sum
const add = (a,b) => +a + +b
/*
REQUIREMENT In my fishing guide service, I use a unique way of calculating tips. I round every guide's tips down to the nearest 10, and give the excess to the boat cleaner.
*/
//TODO: On the following lines, create a function named roundDownToTens that takes in a positive integer and returns that integer rounded down to the nearest 10
const roundDownToTens = a => a - a%10
/*
REQUIREMENT I took out a couple interest only loans to launch this guide service. I think that I'm being overcharged. Help me out! If I just pay the interest amount, what should my monthly payments be? Write a function that takes in the principal and interest rate, and returns the monthly interest-only payment.
*/
//TODO: On the following lines, create a function named '' that takes in <> and returns <>
/*
REQUIREMENT There's a lot of taxes involved in business. How much am I really paying? Write a function that takes in a single number, and returns the actual tax rate based on the following tax brackets:
*/
//TODO: On the following lines, create a function named '' that takes in <> and returns <>
/*
REQUIREMENT I like helping out other small business owners. I gave someone $1000 to help launch their pizza company. We haven't worked out the interest rate yet, but they guaranteed that they will pay it back in full 1 year later. In addition to the original $1000, how much interest will this person me?

/*
REQUIREMENT I hand out coupons for 50% off the next fishing trip to anyone who fails to catch a fish. Prices change every year, so write me a function that calculates the post-coupon cost given an initial price.
*/
//TODO: On the following lines, create a function named '' that takes in <> and returns <>

REQUIREMENT I have 1 bait bucket per client. I want an equal amount of bait in each bucket at the start of the day. I want to know how much pieces of bait will be left over after placing an equal amount in each bucket. Write a function that takes in a number of buckets and number of pieces of bait, and returns the remainder.

/*
REQUIREMENT The pizza restaurant owner just informed me that they might need to wait longer before paying me back. How much will they owe me?

You've reached the end of this exercise! If you need more practice with data types, you're in luck.
You'll use these concepts in every subsequent program you write.
